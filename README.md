This is a PCB design for the outside foil tester as presented and designed by the YouTube channel RestoreOldRadios. I don't like prototyping PCB's so I made a "real" one. I don't do that to often so it's a nice exercise in using Kicad.

Everything seems to be working fine for the smaller value capacitors. but at "larger" values the detected signal gets to low for the Arduino to measure. And larger is 0.1uF and more. Also I found that capacitors with the cardboard tubes and the modern yellow ones test fine. But I also have vintage ones using a plastic tube as a housing. That type also doesn't measure. Might be that the plastic is to much of an insulator
